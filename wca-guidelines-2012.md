# WCA Guidelines 2012

The WCA Guidelines supplement the WCA Regulations. Guidelines are numbered in correspondence with related regulations.

To make the Regulations and Guidelines easier to read we use "he" where the reader should read "she or he".
The use of the words "must", "must not", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not" and "may" comply with RFC 2119.

Note the following:
- Mutiple guidelines may correspond to the same Regulation.
- Several guidelines were moved from a previous version of the Regulations, with their numbering preserved (and therefore are not numbered corresponding to an existing Regulation). These are marked with [SEPARATE].
- For informational reasons, each Guideline is classified using one of the following labels. Note that this should be treated as metadata, not a description of importance.
  - [ADDITION] Additional information to supplement the Regulations.
  - [CLARIFICATION] Information to address any possible questions about interpretation of the Regulations.
  - [EXPLANATION] Information that clarifies the intent of Regulations.
  - [RECOMMENDATION] Something that is not strictly mandatory, but that should be done if possible.
  - [REMINDER] Information that may be addressed other Regulations/Guideline, but whose relevance is worth reiterating.


## Article 1: Officials

- 1c3) [RECOMMENDATION] Results should be ready at the end of the last day of competition.
- 1c3b) [CLARIFICATION] If there are multiple groups, it is not necessary to identify which competitor was in which heats.
- 1c4) [RECOMMENDATION] Corrections to the results should be available within one week of the competition date.
- 1c10) [CLARIFICATION] It is sufficient to ensure access to a digital copy of the Regulations.
- 1h) [RECOMMENDATION] All final rounds of all events, as well as all Fewest Moves Solving rounds, should have the same scrambles for all competitors (i.e. only 1 heat).
- 1h1) [CLARIFICATION] Judges should not start judging other competitors in their own heat before they have finished all their attempts. However, sometimes it is useful to permit judges to start judging other competitors in their own heat before they have finished all their attempts. The organization team must ensure that no judge is able to see a scramble for one of their attempts before they attempt it.


## Article 2: Competitors

- 2c) [ADDITION] First-time competitors should register using their legal name. They may register using a reasonable nickname, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.

- 2d) [ADDITION] Date of birth and contact information should be especially secured.
- 2d) [RECOMMENDATION] If a third party (e.g. journalist) asks the organisation team to be put in contact with any competitor(s), the competitor(s) should first be asked for consent.
[NOTE: I know it says "should", but can clarification be given for 2e?  In the USA, we often do not ask for identification for people claiming to be US citizens.  Is this allowed/forbidden/tolerated?]
- 2h) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may be barefoot for Solving With Feet.
- 2j2) [EXAMPLE] For example, if a competitor is disqualified from an event for failing to show up for the final round, his results from earlier rounds remain valid.
- 2s3) [REMINDER] Special accommodations shall be noted in the Delegate Report.


## Article 3: Puzzles

- 3a) [ADDITION] By default, a competitor shall use the same puzzle for consecutive attempts in a speed solving round. A competitor may switch puzzles between attempts, at the discretion of the judge or WCA Delegate.
- 3a) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may borrow puzzles from other competitors privately, to use in competition.
- 3a1) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may be disqualified if they do not come when they are called, or if they do not have a puzzle ready to submit (e.g. if they planned to use a puzzle that another competitor is currently using, and therefore cannot submit their puzzle at the moment).
- 3b) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may use puzzles of any reasonable size, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 3i) [EXAMPLE] Examples of enhancements include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colours on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, or the puzzles has more/different solved states.


## Article 4: Scrambling

- 4b1) [REMINDER] The WCA Delegate must never re-generate any scrambles to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not be permitted to glance at the scrambles for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate "fairer" scrambles.
- 4b2) [CLARIFICATION] In general, all official scramble sequences should be kept secret during the competition and published together after the end of the competition (see Regulation 1c3a). In some cases (e.g. world records), the organisation team may wish to release specific scrambles sooner after the end of a round.
- 4d) [CLARIFICATION] Some puzzles use standard color schemes, except that black is replaced with white. In this case, black is the darkest color and shall not be treated as white.
- 4f) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scrambles for the entire competition ahead of time, including spare scrambles for extra attempts.

## Article 5: Puzzle Defects

- 5b5) [EXAMPLE] Example of a piece not fully placed: a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot.
- 5b5) [EXAMPLE] Example of judging an attempt ending with a defective puzzle: A pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states, one fully solved, and two "+2" states. An attempt ending in such a situation would be assigned a "+2" penalty.


## Article 6: Awards/prizes/honours

- 9f5) [CLARIFICATION] The result for an attempt shall only be DNS if the competitor was eligible for the attempt and did not attempt it. If the competitor did not qualify for an attempt (e.g. in a combined round), he does not have any result for the attempt. In case a competitor declines to solve any attempts for a round, 
- 9q) [SEPARATE][RECOMMENDATION] Events and rounds should have at least 2 competitors.

## Article 10: Solved State

- 10f) [EXPLANATION] The misalignment limits are selected so that they provide a natural cutoff between one state of a puzzle (without penalty) and a state one move away.


## Article 11: Incidents

- 11e) [CLARIFICATION] Since an appeal is not guaranteed to be successful, the competitor may choose to keep the timer running while appealing it, and resume the attempt when appropriate.

## Article A: Speed Solving

- A1a2) [ADDITION] In case of a cumulative time limit, the judge shall record the original recorded time for a DNF on the score sheet in parentheses, e.g. "DNF (1:02.27)".
- A1a3) [REMINDER] The organisation team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two attempts in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a combined round), and that changing time limits after the beginning of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.
- A1a4) [REMINDER] If a competitor has accidentally been permitted to exceed the time limit, the time limit must be enforced retroactively, and the judge, competitor, and WCA Delegate should be informed (see Regulation 1g2). Judges shall always be aware of the time limit for a current attempt (which might depend on previous attempts, in the case of a cumulative time limit).
- A1a5) [CLARIFICATION] Since it is only required that the original recorded time must be under the time limit, the result for an attempt may be over the time limit after time penalties are assigned.
- A2c1) [CLARIFICATION] In the past, score cards have been used to cover puzzles while leaving somes sides exposed. This is no longer permitted.
- A3c3) [CLARIFICATION] Although the judge is required to reset the timer for the competitor (see Regulation A3b), the competitor may reset it before/during the inspection phase if the judge accidentally neglected to do so.

## Article H: Multiple Blindfolded Solving

- H1b1) [REMINDER] The attempt is not disqualified for reaching the time limit, due to exceptions for Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see Regulations A1a4 and A1a5).
- H1b1) [ADDITION] The judge may permit the competitor to continue the attempt unofficially, but the attempt must be stopped and judged first, in full accordance with the Regulations.
- H1d) [EXAMPLE] Example: If a competitor attempts 10 cubes, stops with a time of 59:57, and has two time penalties, the time for the result is 59:57 + 2*2 = 60:01 (also see Guideline A1a5).
- H1d) [EXAMPLE] Example: If a competitor attempts 10 cubes, and the judge stops him at one 60 minutes, and has two time penalties, the time for the result is 60:00 + 2*2 = 60:04 (also see Guideline A1a5).
